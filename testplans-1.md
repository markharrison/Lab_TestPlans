## Overview

 Azure DevOps provide rich and powerful tools everyone in the team can use to drive quality and collaboration throughout the development process. The easy-to-use, browser-based test management solution provides all the capabilities required for planned manual testing, user acceptance testing, exploratory testing, and gathering feedback from stakeholders.

## Create Project / Application sample

Use Azure DevOps Projects <https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/microsoft.visualstudio%2Faccount%2Fproject>

- Create a .NET project ... suggest use Windows AppService F1 free tier

When the project has provisioned, the following has happenend:

- a sample application is stored in a Azure DevOps repo
- infrastructure as code ARM template is stored in the same Azure DevOps repo (different top level folder)
- build and release pipelines are generated, and invoked
- an Azure DevOps Project dashboard is generated.

Note on the Azure DevOps Project dashboard links to the AzureDevs homepage, repos, pipelines and boards.

## Pipelines - Automated Testing

Also note on the Azure DevOps Project dashboard that the pipelines did some automated testing.

In the Build pipeline there was one unit test executed and this passed successfully.
